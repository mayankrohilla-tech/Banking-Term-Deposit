🏦 Banking Term Deposit Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using machine learning techniques. The objective is to help banks optimize marketing campaigns, improve conversion rates, and enhance customer targeting strategies.

📌 Problem Statement

Banks run direct marketing campaigns to promote term deposits. However, response rates are typically low. This project builds predictive models to identify customers who are more likely to subscribe, enabling data-driven decision-making.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains structured banking data including:

Customer demographics (age, job, marital status, education)
Financial details (balance, loan status)
Campaign information (contact type, duration, previous outcomes)
Target variable: Term deposit subscription (Yes/No)
